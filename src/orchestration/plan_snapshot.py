"""Plan snapshot persistence (Plan §Phase 6, C5).

When the Planner validates a plan, the derived :class:`TaskGraph` is persisted
as a ``PlanSnapshot`` keyed by ``workflow_id``. A later production execution
request loads the snapshot and validates that the plan it is about to run is the
same plan that was approved (matching ``workflow_id`` / ``user_id`` /
``plan_hash`` / ``schema_version``) before entering the scheduler -- otherwise
execution is refused and a re-plan is required.

The snapshot is stored on disk (atomic write) under ``PLAN_SNAPSHOT_DIR`` (or
``store/plan_snapshots`` by default), separate from the generic checkpoint.

    deep-comparing it (normalized) against the snapshot's stored task graph:

    1. schema/converter versions must match (else a re-plan is required);
    2. workflow id / user id must match the request;
    3. ``snapshot_hash`` must match the snapshot's own content (detects file
       corruption / inconsistent hand edits);
    4. Contract and produces injection for the rebuild comes from the CURRENT
       trusted registry (``current_agent_contracts`` / ``current_agent_produces``),
       never from the snapshot itself, so a snapshot stripped of its Contract
       fields (or taken before an Agent adopted a Contract) cannot demote that
       Agent to the schema-free legacy path;
    5. the execution-relevant graph rebuilt from trusted request identity, goal, current
       planning steps, trusted TaskProfile subtasks, and current Agent Contracts
       must be byte-identical (after normalization) to the stored graph. Any
       drift in the spec, operation modes, preferred resources, dependencies,
       Contract, or output bindings is rejected. Diagnostic-only operation-mode
       provenance text is excluded because it cannot affect execution.

    On success the stored (approved) task graph dict is returned for injection.
    A caller that has already authenticated trusted governance-administrator
    attributes may set ``allow_trusted_plan_update``; in that case a valid graph
    rebuilt from the current trusted plan and registry replaces a stale graph.
    Ordinary callers still fail closed on every executable-field mismatch.
