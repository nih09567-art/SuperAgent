# Agent Contract v1

Agent Contract v1 defines stable business inputs and outputs independently of
the tools used to obtain them. This version applies to
`RemoteHRAssistantAgent`, `RemoteKnowledgeAgent`, and `RemoteReportAgent`.
Agents without a contract continue to use the legacy registration and execution
path.

This document specifies the contract data that the runtime validates. The
Scheduler currently normalizes contracted and compatible legacy Agent results
before publishing Artifacts, and assembles synthetic fan-in inputs before the
consumer Agent runs; this document does not redefine those Scheduler policies.

## Scope of runtime enforcement

Contracted results are enforced on the runtime execution path. The result
normalization layer installs the built-in schema catalog, attaches the
versioned semantic validators (including the provenance invariants for
`policy.info@v2`), and runs `validate_agent_result` on every contracted result
before it reaches downstream steps. A caller-provided Registry may retain a
stricter structural schema, but the built-in semantic validator is still
attached for the corresponding versioned Agent schema.

`DataContractRef.required` and `cardinality` are declared for forward
compatibility and are not enforced by v1 validation.

## Contract

An `AgentContract` has a `contract_version`, `requires`, and `produces`.
Each data reference contains:

```json
{
  "name": "employee.info",
  "schema_ref": "employee.info@v1",
  "required": true,
  "cardinality": "one"
}
```

`name` is a business logical name, never a tool name. `schema_ref` must resolve
through the existing `SchemaRegistry`. Contract v1 uses exact schema versions
and fails closed when a schema is missing or mismatched. A registry entry whose
contract declares names without schema refs is rejected at sync time: that
Agent is not registered, while the rest of the batch continues to load.

Registry metadata may additionally declare `legacy_produces`: logical names
that predate the contract and are still referenced by planner dependency
chains (for example `employee.id` and `employee.name`). They are appended to
the Agent's planner-visible `produces` but stay outside the strict contract,
so they require no schema refs and are not validated.

Optional Contract entries remain in `requires` or `produces` and are listed by
name in `optional_requires` or `optional_produces`. Names in either optional
list must also exist in the corresponding Contract list; otherwise that Agent
entry is rejected during registry synchronization.

## Result envelope

Every contracted Agent returns:

```json
{
  "contract_version": "1.0",
  "status": "success",
  "outputs": {
    "employee.info": {
      "records": [],
      "matched_count": 0
    }
  },
  "error": null,
  "metadata": {
    "producer_agent": "RemoteHRAssistantAgent",
    "schema_version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

The allowed statuses are `success`, `partial`, and `error`.

- `success` contains at least one output and no error.
- `error` contains a standard error and no outputs.
- `partial` contains both valid outputs and a standard error.
- Every output logical name is declared by the Agent's `produces`.
- Every output payload validates against its declared schema.

The standard error is:

```json
{
  "code": "REMOTE_TOOL_TIMEOUT",
  "message": "remote_person_info_tool timed out",
  "retryable": true,
  "details": {
    "tool": "remote_person_info_tool"
  }
}
```

Metadata is deliberately allow-listed. It must not contain credentials, full
request context, or sensitive business content.

## Schema catalog

Contract v1 registers these schemas in the existing `SchemaRegistry`:

- `employee.info@v1`: employee record collection, optional query and match count.
- `employee.salary@v1`: salary record collection and match count.
- `policy.info@v1`: query, answer, knowledge item count, and policy scope. The
  provenance group (`sources`, `matched_items`, and `not_found`) is optional as
  a whole for compatibility with v1 callers. If any provenance field is present,
  all three must be present; partial provenance metadata is contract-invalid.
- `policy.info@v2`: keeps the v1 fields and requires provenance metadata. A
  successful match must provide aligned, non-empty `sources` and `matched_items`;
  each source must identify its category, source, demo status, and effective or
  snapshot date; the top-level `policy_scope` must summarize the source scopes;
  a `not_found` result must report `policy_scope=unknown`, a zero count, and
  empty lists. Source and matched-item IDs must form the same unique set; their
  display order is not part of the contract. The v1 schema remains registered
  for compatibility with older tools.
- `report.sources@v1`: generic report sources, instruction, and title.
- `report.markdown@v1`: title, Markdown body, and source count.

`policy_scope` is one of `company`, `statutory`, `mixed`, or `unknown`.
The Knowledge Agent envelope still uses contract version `1.0`; `@v2` versions
the `policy.info` data shape rather than the envelope protocol.
Statutory material must not be presented as a current internal company policy.
For a matched result, `knowledge_items_count` must equal the lengths of `sources`
and `matched_items`, source IDs must match item IDs, and IDs and source names
must be non-empty. The top-level `policy_scope` must be derived from source
scopes. One distinct source scope is preserved; multiple distinct source scopes
produce `mixed`. For an unmatched result, the count and both arrays must be
empty and `policy_scope` must be `unknown`.

## Pilot contracts

`RemoteHRAssistantAgent` produces `employee.info` and, only for an explicit
salary request, `employee.salary`.

`RemoteKnowledgeAgent` produces `policy.info`. The current demonstration
knowledge base is stored in `assets/knowledge_base.json`; the tool performs a
small keyword match, removes candidates scoring below half of the best match,
and sends at most three entries to the LLM. Results default to
`policy_scope=statutory` unless the tool supplies explicit provenance. Demo
fixtures use `is_demo=true`; `effective_date` is reserved for an actual policy
effective date, while `source_updated_at` records the date of a demonstration
source snapshot. When no item matches, the tool returns `not_found=true`, an
empty `sources` list, and does not call the LLM.

`RemoteReportAgent` requires the generic `report.sources` input and produces
`report.markdown`. Its contract is not tied to HR-specific source names.
Because `report.sources` is a synthetic fan-in input that no single Agent
produces, the Scheduler assembles it from upstream Artifacts before invoking
the Report Agent. The planner and runtime therefore keep the generic
`report.sources@v1` boundary rather than assigning ownership of that input to
one producer Agent.

## Validation order

`validate_agent_result` checks:

1. Envelope structure.
2. Status, outputs, and error invariants.
3. Contract version.
4. Declared output logical names.
5. Registered schema references.
6. Payload conformance.

Validation returns structured errors. It never rewrites the Agent result.
