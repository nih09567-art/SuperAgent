"""Offline, deterministic end-to-end demo: the single strong governance scenario.

Scenario (all fictional / mock data; no network, no LLM, no real identity system):

    hr_manager 发起工资汇总任务
    -> TaskGraph: s_query (HR agent, read) -> s_report (reporter, read)
    -> s_query produces an owned artifact (mock employee 王强 / mock salary)
    -> s_report reads it via ArtifactRef and produces a report (no salary body)
    -> engineer tries to read the same artifact -> ownership guard denies
    -> audit log records the deny (metadata only, never the payload)

This drives the REAL scheduler runtime bridge (``run_scheduler_workflow``) with a
Fake Executor + stub routing, so it is fully offline and repeatable. It proves the
acceptance points from the prototype closeout plan (phase 4):

- clear TaskGraph dependency; upstream output flows via ArtifactRef;
- the checkpoint/state carries NO salary plaintext (payload lives in the
  protected payload store, not the checkpoint);
- owner read succeeds; non-owner read fails closed;
- the audit log has no sensitive body;
- a completed step is not re-executed on resume;
- a tampered payload fails recovery;
- the final status is an explicit terminal verdict (not merely "stream ended").
